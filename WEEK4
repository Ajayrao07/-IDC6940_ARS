"Online Payments Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques"

Introduction

1. The Rise of Online Payments
The expansion of e-commerce, computerized managing an account, and fintech developments has changed the money related scene, making online exchanges an basic 
portion of regular life. With the expanding selection of computerized installment stages, counting credit/debit cards, e-wallets, and cryptocurrency exchanges, 
the volume of online installments has surged exponentially.
2. The Developing Risk of Fraud
As advanced installment frameworks extend, they ended up profitable targets for cybercriminals. False exercises such as unauthorized exchanges, personality robbery,
phishing, chargeback extortion, and manufactured character extortion posture genuine dangers to people and monetary educate. Reports from the Affiliation of C
ertified Extortion Inspectors (ACFE) and Juniper Investigate appraise that worldwide online installment extortion misfortunes will outperform billions of dollars
every year, making extortion location a best need for businesses and administrative authorities.
3. Limitations of Traditional Fraud Detection Methods
Historically, extortion discovery depended on rule-based frameworks, where predefined rules and edges hailed suspicious exchanges. In any case, these strategies
are progressively incapable due to:
Lack of flexibility: Fraudsters persistently advance their strategies, making inactive rule-based frameworks outdated.
High untrue positives: Numerous authentic exchanges are erroneously hailed as false, driving to client disappointment and income loss.
High operational costs: Manual confirmation of hailed exchanges is time-consuming and expensive.
4. The Part of Machine Learning in Extortion Detection
Machine learning (ML) has risen as a effective device for extortion location by leveraging data-driven strategies to analyze exchange designs and distinguish 
peculiarities. Not at all like rule-based frameworks, ML models ceaselessly learn from unused information and adjust to advancing extortion designs. Key points
of interest of machine learning in extortion discovery include:
Automated include extraction: ML models can distinguish complex extortion designs that are troublesome to identify manually.
Improved exactness: By decreasing untrue positives and untrue negatives, ML guarantees more exact extortion detection.
Real-time decision-making: ML-based extortion location frameworks can analyze exchanges in genuine time, avoiding monetary misfortunes some time recently they occur.
5. Key Challenges in Extortion Detection
Despite the points of interest, executing ML-based extortion location presents a few challenges:
Class awkwardness issue: False exchanges speak to a little division of generally exchanges, making it troublesome for models to learn effectively.
Concept float: Extortion methodologies advance over time, requiring models to be persistently updated.
Computational complexity: Real-time extortion location requires high-speed preparing to analyze expansive exchange datasets inside milliseconds.

Background/Motivation:

The surge in online exchanges has been paralleled by a noteworthy increment in false exercises, posturing considerable challenges to monetary teach and customers
alike. Conventional extortion location frameworks, frequently rule-based, battle to keep pace with the advancing strategies of fraudsters. This paper addresses
the basic require for versatile and vigorous extortion location components by investigating the application of different machine learning calculations to recognize 
false online installment exchanges. The investigate points to fill crevices in existing writing by giving a comparative examination of these calculations, 
subsequently contributing to the improvement of more successful extortion location frameworks.

Methods Used:

The authors implemented a structured approach to evaluate the efficacy of different machine learning models in detecting fraudulent transactions. 
The methodology encompasses several key stages:

1) Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values: Missing data can introduce biases and affect model performance. The authors employed techniques such as imputation to fill in 
missing values, ensuring a complete dataset for analysis.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features were transformed into numerical representations using methods like one-hot encoding, facilitating their 
use in machine learning models.
Feature Scaling: Continuous variables were normalized to a standard scale, typically using z-score normalization:
z= X‚àíŒº/œÉ
where X is the original value, Œº is the mean, and œÉ is the standard deviation.

2)Feature Selection:
Correlation Analysis: The authors calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the linear relationship between features and 
the target variable (fraudulent or non-fraudulent).Features with high correlation to the target were retained:
$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}
$$
where ùëãùëñ and ùëåùëñ are individual sample points, X~ and Y~ are the means of the respective variables.

3) Model Selection and Training:
Logistic Regression: Models the probability of a transaction being fraudulent using the logistic function:
The logistic regression model is given by:
$$
P(Y=1 \mid X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \beta_i X_i)}}
$$
Decision Trees: Utilize a tree structure where nodes represent feature tests, branches represent outcomes, and leaves represent class labels. 
The Gini impurity measure is often used to determine the best splits.
Random Forests: An ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and decisions are made based on majority voting.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. For non-linearly separable data, kernel functions
like the Radial Basis Function (RBF) are used.
Gradient Boosting Machines: Builds an ensemble of trees sequentially, where each tree attempts to correct the errors of its predecessor. The model minimizes a
differentiable loss function using gradient descent.

4)Model Evaluation:
Confusion Matrix: A table used to describe the performance of a classification model, with metrics such as True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), 
True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN).
Performance Metrics: Calculated as follows:
Accuracy: (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
‚ÄãPrecision: (TP)/(TP+FP)
‚ÄãRecall (Sensitivity): (TP)/(TP+FN)
‚ÄãF1-Score: 2√ó (Precision√óRecall)/(Precision+Recall)
‚ÄãArea Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): Represents the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
